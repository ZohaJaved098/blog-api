# API Integration Project (Learning Fetch, Axios, and Next.js)

This project was developed to enhance my understanding of API integration across different methods and technologies, completed during my internship at Qwerty Experts. The focus was on learning how to fetch data, manage local storage, and implement CRUD functionality in a blogging website using Next.js routing.

### Project Overview
This is a **CRUD blogging website** where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The project showcases my progression in learning API integration:

1. **Fetch API with Local Storage**: Initially, I used the Fetch API to retrieve and manage data from a dummy REST API (JSONPlaceholder) and stored responses in Local Storage.
2. **Axios with Local Storage**: I then improved API handling by switching to Axios, maintaining data persistence with Local Storage.
3. **Next.js with App Routing and Axios**: Finally, I built the project as a Next.js application, implementing **Next.js App Routing** for the blogging functionality. I used Axios for API requests and set up CRUD operations to manage blog posts.

### Technologies Used
- **Fetch API**: For initial data fetching and response handling.
- **Axios**: For enhanced API handling, with Local Storage for data persistence.
- **Next.js**: For creating a responsive CRUD blog layout with App Routing and leveraging SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For minimal styling of the website.

**Note**: This project is primarily a learning exercise to understand and implement API integration techniques, focusing on Fetch, Axios, Next.js, and CRUD functionality.
